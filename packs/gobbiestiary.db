I will attempt to guide you as best I can on how to bring him to justice, for I would very much like to see that after he captured me and made me his court jester.</p>\n<p>First thing you must know about the Bad King is that he absolutely despises fate for making him a goblin. He says that he is too short for a king of his import and that he should have been a hobgoblin instead. Perhaps that's what drove him to climb the ranks to chieftain. Because of his height insecurities, he will always try to cast Enlarge on himself before any non goblins see him. Making him seem larger and more intimidating.</p>\n<p>As a spellcaster, he is extra dangerous. He likes to cast boneshaker to make those who anger him bow deeply as they beg for him to stop rattling their skeleton. He also is a master manipulator, casting charm to make those who would try to parley with him acquiesce to his demands.</p>\n<p>Gobbie Bog cares not for his fellow goblin, and seems to see himself as above them. He will not hesitate to use them as meat shields or throw them at his enemies in order to gain the advantage in combat.</p>\n<p>He wields a modified dogslicer encrusted with runes and jewels that he calls his \"King's Slicer\".</p>\n<h3><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-049de2af-7fff-bd8b-e4bc-376d68cf60d2\">The Bad King's Castle</strong></h3>\n<p>Not to be confused with an actual castle, this winding cave system seems to have two priorities, inflating Gobbie Bog's ego with paintings, and statues that he has taken (most of which have been crudely reshaped in his image), and killing all those who would try to attack him.</p>\n<p>The castle is filled with traps that when armed, only affect tall creatures. As well as heaps of minions who seem to do nothing but make the cave system look more and more like a castle when not off raiding or fighting off intruders.</p>\n<p>His castle's defenses utilize every goblin I have written about so far, plus others you may have seen before like war chanters and warriors.</p>\n<p>The castle is completely unlit, except for his throne room which is lit with a few regularly replaced torches.
